## About

This app was created as part of a Udacity Front End Web Development Nanodegree project. Udacity provided the starter code for a site that was poorly laid out and not accessible. I added responsive design, accessibility features, and the caching of visited pages for offline viewing.

## Installation

Download the files to view the code.<br/>
Launch a local client server using Python from your terminal: 
* Python 2: python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000 
* Python 3: python3 -m http.server 8000

Visit the site in your browser at http://localhost:8000.

## Acknowledgements

* The code for the service worker, which caches pages for offline viewing, was developed with help from this [service worker tutorial](https://developers.google.com/web/ilt/pwa/lab-caching-files-with-service-worker) from Google.

* This [Color Contrast Checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) was helpful in determining which text colors would be accessible to all users.

* This [Flexbox Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_flexbox.asp) from W3Schools was helpful in creating responsive layouts.

## Contributing

This is a project for a course, so I will not be actively maintaining it.
